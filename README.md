## Summary
<!-- You would think a calculator is fairly easy to code the logic for, but there are some challenging aspects when dealing with strings and numbers; trying to sum them in a mathematical equation, make sure only one decimal point is allowed, etc.

Through the use of "truthy" and "falsy" checks, I simplied the validation of input data.  Comparing a boolean value of whether the object has usable data, instead of checking the specific value, lead to shorter, cleaner code.

This was a lot of fun to develop, and I thought it was going to take a weeks.  It only took three days, from the first line of code, to the final styling. -->
